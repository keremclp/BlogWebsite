                        <p>Each possible move represents a different game. A diffrent universe in which you make a better move. By the second move there are 72,084 possible game. By the third nine million ! By the fourth billion ! There are more possible games of chess than there are atoms in the universe.No one predicts the outcome of all even computers which means that the first move can be terrified. The furthest point from the end of the game, there is a virtually infinite sea of possibilities between you and the other side but it also means if you make a mistake there is a nearly infinite amount of ways to fix it. You should simply relax and play :)) </p>

                        <p>Football is a game I have played since I was a child. teams from every neighborhood and we used to play matches with each other. We even used to play matches where the losing team got a coke to the winning team. Now I see that there are no children playing matches in the neighborhoods, this makes me very sad.</p>
                        <p>I support Galatasaray team in Turkey and Arsenal team in England. It gives me pleasure to watch and play separately. This hobby is a hobby that I can't quit no matter how many years pass :)</p>

                        <p>Among the movies I've watched, my favorite series is Prison Break. It's an exciting series where you can hear your heart's voice when you watch it. It is a top-notch series in terms of its editing and the quality of the actors. A series where you can never predict the next event. I strongly recommend. I've just started watching a series called Blaclist, I've heard the name a lot, let's see, I hope I enjoy it :)</p>
